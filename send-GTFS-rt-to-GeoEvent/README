This script is very simple but very valuable in that it provides a fast and easy way to consume GTFS-rt feeds and send the data to the ArcGIS GeoEvent Extension for Server via TCP.  

Requirements:

- ArcGIS for Server with the GeoEvent Extension
- GeoEvent TCP input 
- Access to a GTFS-rt feed (i.e. http://www.cttransit.com/about/developers/gtfsdata/)
- Python runtime
- Python GTFS bindings 

Edit the hostname and port in the script to match your environment, i.e. the hostname would be the server on which GeoEvent is running and the port would be the port you configured for the TCP input.
