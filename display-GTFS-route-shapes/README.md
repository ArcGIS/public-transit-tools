# display-gtfs-route-shapes

The Display GTFS Route Shapes tool converts the information from the GTFS routes.txt and shapes.txt files into an ArcGIS feature class, allowing you to view your transit lines on a map.  The output will contain one line feature for each unique shape in your GTFS data.  The attributes for each line contain all the information about the routes represented by the shape.

## Features
* Conversion - Convert GTFS shapes.txt data to an ArcGIS feature class
* ArcGIS toolbox - No coding is required to use this tool.  Just add the toolbox to ArcMap and use the tools like any other geoprocessing tools.

## Instructions

1. To simply use the tool, download the latest release and follow the included User's Guide.
2. If you want to play with the code, fork it and have fun.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS 10.0 or higher with a Desktop Basic (ArcView) license, or ArcGIS Pro.
* A valid GTFS dataset that contains the optional shapes.txt file.
