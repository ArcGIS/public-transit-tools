# generate-GTFS-shapes

The Generate GTFS Shapes toolbox produces a shapes.txt file for your GTFS dataset.  You give the tool a valid, existing GTFS dataset, and the tool creates a new shape.txt file and updates the shape_id field in trips.txt and the shape_dist_traveled field in stop_times.txt.  Alternatively, if you already have a shapes.txt file, you can use this toolbox to edit one or more of the existing shapes.

## Features
* Create a shapes.txt file for your GTFS dataset.
* Edit one or more shapes in your existing shapes.txt file.
* Start from a reasonable estimate of the shapes and use the editing tools in ArcGIS to make them perfect.
* ArcGIS toolbox - No coding is required to use this tool.  Just add the toolbox to ArcMap and use the tools like any other geoprocessing tools.

## Instructions

1. To simply use the tool, download the latest release and follow the included User's Guide.
2. If you want to play with the code, fork it and have fun.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS 10.2.1 or higher with a Desktop Basic (ArcView) license, or ArcGIS Pro 1.2 or higher. (To run the ArcGIS Online version of Step 1, you will need ArcGIS 10.3 or higher or ArcGIS Pro.)
* If you want to generate on-street route shapes (as opposed to straight lines connecting stops), you will need either a Network Analyst extension and a network dataset or an ArcGIS Online account with routing privileges and sufficient credits for your analysis.  Learn more in the [User's Guide](https://github.com/ArcGIS/public-transit-tools/blob/master/generate-GTFS-shapes/UsersGuide.md).
