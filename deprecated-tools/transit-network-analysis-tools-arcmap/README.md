# transit-network-analysis-tools-arcmap

The *Transit Network Analysis Tools* are a set of tools for performing transit-specific network analysis. They are intended to supplement the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension by accounting for the time-dependent nature of public transit and to assist with analyses commonly needed by those working with public transit.  For example, the tools provided here can help you perform accessibility calculations and show how the area reachable by transit changes throughout the day.

The *Transit Network Analysis Tools* must be used with a transit-enabled network dataset created either with the downloadable [Add GTFS to a Network Dataset toolset](http://arcg.is/10jXez) in ArcMap or using the [tools available natively in ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/network-analysis-with-public-transit-data.htm).

**This version of the toolbox is deprecated.** The tool author will no longer be making further enhancements or fixing major bugs. Instead, you should use the newer version of this tool, which works with ArcGIS Pro only, and is available [here](https://github.com/Esri/public-transit-tools/blob/master/transit-network-analysis-tools).

## Features
* Visualize transit service areas (transitsheds)
* Study accessibility of destinations by transit.
* Calculate travel time statistics
* ArcGIS toolbox - No coding is required to use this tool.  Use the tools like any other geoprocessing tools.

## Instructions

1. To simply use the tool, download it here or from [ArcGIS.com](https://arcg.is/1u8WKS) and follow the [User's Guide](https://github.com/Esri/public-transit-tools/blob/master/deprecated-tools/transit-network-analysis-tools-arcmap/UsersGuide.md).
2. If you want to play with the code, fork it and have fun.

## Requirements

* ArcMap 10.2 or higher or ArcGIS Pro 2.4 or higher. A Desktop Basic license is sufficient.
  * Note: If you're using ArcGIS Pro, you should use the newer version of this tool, which is available [here](https://github.com/Esri/public-transit-tools/blob/master/transit-network-analysis-tools).
* A transit-enabled network dataset created either with the downloadable [Add GTFS to a Network Dataset toolset](http://arcg.is/10jXez) in ArcMap or using the [tools available natively in ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/network-analysis-with-public-transit-data.htm).
