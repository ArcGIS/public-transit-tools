# deprecated-tools
The tools described in this folder are DEPRECATED. The tools will no longer be updated, and support for them is
limited. Their functionality is now available out of the box in the core ArcGIS software, so you should already
have everything you need!

What are these tools, and why are they deprecated? The tools in this folder were experimental, prototype tools which we
used to explore the possibilities for analysis with GTFS data in ArcGIS and to solicit feedback
from the community (that means you!). They were great tools, but we don't need them anymore because we have
now added equivalent functionality to the core ArcGIS software. You should already have everything you need out
of the box with no need for additional downloads or installs. The tools are included here for archival purposes
for those of you who may still be using them or who may want to use them as examples when developing their own tools.
If you just want to use the tools, you are highly encouraged to use the newer core tools because they
are better, faster, and easier to use.
